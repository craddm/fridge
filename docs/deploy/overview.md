# Deploying a FRIDGE

Deploying a FRIDGE is a multi-stage process.

1. Deploy the networking infrastructure and Kubernetes clusters
1. Deploy FRIDGE services into the access cluster
1. Deploy FRIDGE services into the isolated cluster
1. Perform a final networking lockdown

The `Hosting Provider Administrators` are responsible for the first and final steps.

The `TRE Administrators` are responsible for the second and third steps.

For `Hosting Provider Administrators`, follow the guide in [Deploy Infrastructure](./infrastructure.md)

For `TRE Administrators`, follow the guide in [Deploy Services](./services.md)

## Prerequisites

You will need the following tools installed to deploy FRIDGE:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.11 or later
- [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [NetBird](https://docs.netbird.io/get-started/install)

Additionally, if deploying to Azure, you will need the following:

- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

### NetBird

Access to a deployed FRIDGE, either for `TRE Administrators` or `TRE Users`, is through a Virtual Private Network managed using [NetBird](https://netbird.io)
Deploying the

You will require access to a NetBird Management server.
For testing and development, the free NetBird cloud management server is sufficient.
However, for production, we recommend using [self-hosted NetBird](https://docs.netbird.io/selfhosted/selfhosted-quickstart).

### Pulumi Backend

Pulumi stores state in a backend.
The [Pulumi documentation](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/concepts/state-and-backends/) details how to set up an appropriate backend.
For local development and testing, you can use the local backend:

```console
pulumi login --local
```

For production, another backend, such as Azure Blob Storage, will likely be more appropriate.
